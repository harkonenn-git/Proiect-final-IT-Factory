## ABOUT ME

I’m naturally detail-oriented, which means I notice even the smallest inconsistencies or bugs that might be missed by others. My curiosity drives me to understand how everything works and to dig into potential weaknesses or edge cases. I’m patient and persistent, willing to tackle repetitive tasks and long hours of investigation to ensure thorough coverage.

I approach problems with a critical mindset, questioning assumptions and exploring various angles to identify underlying issues. Effective communication is crucial for me. I clearly articulate problems, document my findings, and collaborate closely with developers and other team members to resolve issues.

I’m adaptable, embracing new tools, technologies, and methodologies as they evolve alongside the development process. My passion for quality drives me to ensure that the final product is reliable and user-friendly. Even though I often work independently, I value teamwork and understand that collaboration is key to successful software development.
